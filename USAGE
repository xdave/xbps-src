xbps-src - building XBPS binary packages from source
====================================================

Introduction
------------
`xbps-src` is the utility used by the _X binary package system_ to build
binary packages from source distribution files. A root directory (`srcpkgs`)
contains multiple subdirs, each one to build a package as its name
indicates. The following directory structure illustrates it:

  xbps-packages/
      |
      |-----srcpkgs/
               |
               |-----binutils/
               |-----gcc/
               |-----glibc/

A package subdirectory always has a `template` file, that are the
specifications to download and build the binary package from its source files.
Additionally some packages may have additional subdirs on it: `files`
and `patches`. The `files` subdir may contain configuration files, or
any other file required to build the package. The `patches` subdir contains
patches that are applied to the source before building.

Some packages may provide `subpackages`; they are different binary packages
that are built from the same source package. Each `subpackage` in the directory
structure (as shown above) is a symlink to the `real` package subdir, like this:

  srcpkgs/
     |
     |-----gcc/
     |-----libgomp -> gcc
     |-----libmudflap -> gcc
     |-----libstdc++ -> gcc

Each subpackage uses its own `template` build file that is contained in
the `real` package subdir, and they have exactly the same name than the
symlink pointing to the `real` package subdir. The following example
illustrates the structure used by the _udev_ package in the filesystem:

  srcpkgs/
    |
    |-----libgudev-devel -> udev
    |-----libgudev -> udev
    |-----libudev-devel -> udev
    |-----libudev -> udev
    |-----udev/
           |----template
           |----libgudev-devel.template
           |----libgudev.template
           |----libudev-devel.template
           |----libudev.template

Subpackages use a reduced version of the main `template` build file, because
the build and main install process is all done in the real `template` file.
Usually those `<subpkg>.template` files only move files and directories
to the `subpackage` destination directory, so they are always smaller.

Requirements
------------
To build binary packages with xbps-src the following software must be
installed into the host system:

 - awk, bash, gcc c++, gettext, patch, texinfo, perl and fakeroot.
 - sudo (if you want to build packages as 'root')
 - xbps static utilities, available from http://code.google.com/p/xbps.
   (use the latest available stable version) or
   'xbps-bin -y install xbps-static' if using Void GNU/Linux.

Starting up
-----------
Firstly you'll have to download the `git` repository that contains
the build template files (source packages). To clone it with `git` use:

	$ git clone git://github.com/xtraeme/xbps-packages

It is assumed that `xbps-src` has been already installed and it is
usable, i.e the configuration file `xbps-src.conf` has been propertly
changed to suit your needs.

Building packages from source
-----------------------------
`xbps-src` always look for a `template` file in current directory, that's what
it specifies the package build definitions and such. The build templates
are located in the `srcpkgs` directory, you should change the cwd to the
directory matching the package that you want to work on, i.e for binutils,
its directory is `srcpkgs/binutils`.

To avoid problems with libtool and configure scripts finding stuff that is
available in the host system, almost all packages must be built inside of a
chroot. So the first thing would be to create the required set of packages
that will be used in the chroot, i.e a bootstrap:

	$ xbps-src bootstrap

This will build all required packages via fakeroot in masterdir, therefore you
can run it as normal user (unless you had disabled XBPS_USE_CAPABILITIES in
the `xbps-src.conf` configuration file). Once the bootstrap has been built and
installed into the 'masterdir' all packages will be built within the chroot.

Alternatively if you are using Void GNU/Linux you can install a bootstrap
from binary packages with:

	$ xbps-bin -r /path/to/your/masterdir -y install base-chroot

'xbps-src' supports building packages in the chroot with your normal user,
thanks to the *POSIX.1e Capabilities* support in the Linux kernel. To use this
the target filesystem must support *extended attributes*; right now they
are supported on almost all Linux filesytems, such as *ext2*, *ext3*, *ext4*,
*xfs*, and others. This option is enabled by default in *xbps-src.conf*.

I believe it's the most easier and faster way to handle clean dependencies;
another reason would be that xbps packages are meant to be used in a system and
not just for ordinary users. So once all packages are built, you can create and
enter to the chroot with:

	$ xbps-src chroot

Press Control + D to exit from the chroot. The following targets will require
to be done in the chroot (_once base-chroot is installed_):
*build, configure and install*.

Now let's explain some more about the targets that you can use. To start
installing packages you should use the install target, all source packages
are located in the `srcpkgs` directory, so to install glib you can use any
of the two methos explained below:

	$ cd srcpkgs/<pkgname> && xbps-src install
	$ xbps-src install <pkgname>

If the package is properly installed, it will be "stowed" automatically.
``stowed'' means that this package is available in the master directory,
on which `xbps-src` has symlinked all files from DESTDIR/<pkgname>.

To remove a currently installed (and `stowed`) package, you can use:

	$ xbps-src remove <pkgname>

Please note that when you remove it, the package will be removed
from DESTDIR (masterdir/destdir) and `stowed`.

To stow an already installed package (from DESTDIR/<pkgname>):

	$ xbps-src stow <pkgname>

To unstow an already installed (stowed) package:

	$ xbps-src unstow <pkgname>

You can also print some stuff about any template build file, e.g:

	$ xbps-src show <pkgname>

To list installed (stowed) packages, use this:

	$ xbps-src list

To only extract the distfiles, without configuring/building/installing:

	$ xbps-src extract <pkgname>

To not remove the build directory after successful installation:

	$ xbps-src -C install <pkgname>

To only fetch the distfile:

	$ xbps-src fetch <pkgname>

To only install the package, _without_ `stowing` it into the master directory:

	$ xbps-src -D install <pkgname>

To list files installed by a package (note that package must be installed
into destination directory first)

	$ xbps-src show-files <pkgname>
