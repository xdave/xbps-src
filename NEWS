v9:
 - xbps-src now copies /etc/services to the chroot (masterdir) to make
   https URLs work with xbps-uhelper.
 - The home directory of the user running xbps-src for chroot operations
   has been changed to /tmp.
 - The changes listed above are *only* applied on newly created chroots.

v8:
 - xbps-src failed to detect required shlibs from the same package, when
   them were symlinks and not real files.

v7:
 - xbps-src now provides required XBPS configuration file for use in
   chroot operations, adding local repositories by default.

v6:
 - Fixed the 'show-deps' target to show dependencies that contain the +
   character on its pkgname.

v5:
 - Implemented 'show-deps' target to print build or run time dependencies
   for a source package.
 - It's possible to use xbps-src code from non-default PATH by setting the
   environment variable DESTDIR.
